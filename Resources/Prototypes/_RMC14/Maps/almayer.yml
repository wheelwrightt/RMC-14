# The Almayer map file is currently considered private content by RMC14, along with the map file for LV624.
# The Almayer map file is to serve as a solution for a test fail that would result from the lack of its existence otherwise.
# If you wish for this file, or LV624, to be public you may recreate them yourself and PR it to the repo.
